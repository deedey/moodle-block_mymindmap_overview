# moodle_block_mymindmap_overview
The mymindmap_overview block otherwise presents the courses in the dashboard. 

Everyone knows the block myoverview which presents in the dashboard in a paginated form the courses where the user is registered. 

But the block mymindmap_overview has the advantage of seeing all its courses containing at least one module on a single screen zone and being able to navigate to the section, the activity or the chosen resource to access it. 

This view also shows how many modules constitute a course or section, which allows you to only go to courses offering content. 

This plugin uses jsmind javascript tool to design the schemas. You can find it here:
