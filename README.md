# moodle_block_mymindmap_overview

Everyone knows the block myoverview which presents in a paginated form the courses which one is registered in the dashboard.
But the block mymindmap_overview has the advantage of seeing all its courses on one page and being able to navigate to the activity or the chosen resource to access it.
This view also shows how many modules constitute a course or section, which allows you to only go to courses offering content.
